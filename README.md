# Rock-Paper-Scissors 🪨📄✂️

This is a game of rock, paper, scissors made in c++. I made this to showcase my c++ skils and to create something funny that anybody could play! In this game you are going against the calculator! 

## ⚓Features

- Select the number of rounds you want
- If you don't select an option u get an error
- Choose between piatra (rock) , hartie (paper) and foarfeca (scissors)
- At the end of all rounds you get a question if you still want to play the game, if you press yes you play one more round, otherwise the game is over
- After each round you get a score (+1 point for the winner), if it's a tie the score stays the same
